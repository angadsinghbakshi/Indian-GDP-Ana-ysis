# Indian GDP Analysis Project (2019-2023)
# Project Overview:
The Indian GDP Analysis Project was designed to provide a city-wise economic analysis across multiple regions in India from 2019 to 2023. The primary focus of this project was to analyze GDP growth, unemployment rates, youth unemployment rates, and sectoral employment trends across key industries such as tourism, information and communication technology (ICT), small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and services. The project aimed to identify growth opportunities, challenges, and potential future drivers of economic development at the city level, offering insights into the specific economic performance of cities rather than states.

The entire analysis was performed using Python for data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Data Cleaning and Structuring:
The collected data was cleaned using Python (utilizing Pandas and NumPy) to ensure consistency and accuracy. I addressed missing data points, handled formatting inconsistencies, and restructured the datasets for efficient analysis. This step was crucial to harmonize data across various cities, ensuring comparable metrics across different regions and sectors.

Analysis:
City-Wise GDP Growth Analysis:
The analysis began with evaluating the GDP growth of major Indian cities from 2019 to 2023. I computed annual growth rates for each city and used Python to visualize the trends over the years.

Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Pune demonstrated strong economic growth driven by their robust IT and startup ecosystems. These cities contributed significantly to GDP growth, particularly in sectors such as ICT and services.

Unemployment and Youth Unemployment Rate Analysis:
Unemployment data, particularly focusing on youth unemployment, was examined for each city. The goal was to assess the impact of economic shifts on the job market, especially among younger populations.

Sectoral Employment Trends: I conducted a sectoral employment analysis to explore how different industries contributed to employment within each city. This involved a breakdown of key industries such as tourism, ICT, SMEs, and services.

Tourism: Cities like Jaipur, Goa, and Agra, which rely heavily on tourism, witnessed a significant drop in employment during the COVID-19 pandemic but have been showing signs of recovery as domestic tourism rebounds.
ICT: Cities such as Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Chennai emerged as major employment hubs in the ICT sector. Despite the pandemic, these cities saw continuous growth in employment due to the global demand for IT services and digital transformation.
SMEs and Manufacturing: Cities like Surat and Ahmedabad showed significant employment contributions from small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and manufacturing. These cities have strong industrial bases and showed resilience during economic slowdowns by leveraging local industries.
Services Sector: Cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore demonstrated the dominance of the services sector, which remained a key driver of both employment and GDP growth during the analyzed period.
Growth Prospects and Future Potential: Based on the analysis, I provided insights into the future economic prospects of various cities:

Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Pune were identified as cities with strong growth potential in the ICT sector, driven by innovation and continued investment in technology startups.
Mumbai and Delhi, due to their financial services and corporate infrastructure, are expected to remain central economic hubs, attracting both domestic and international investment.
Cities like Jaipur and Varanasi showed promising growth prospects in tourism, especially with increasing domestic travel and government initiatives to boost tourism infrastructure.
Ahmedabad and Surat hold promise for continued growth in manufacturing and SMEs, driven by government policies promoting industrial development and export-driven markets.
Visualization and Insights:
Using Pythonâ€™s visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, I created graphs and charts to visualize GDP growth trends, unemployment statistics, and sectoral employment distributions for each city. These visualizations allowed for clear and intuitive insights into which cities and sectors were driving economic growth and which areas needed intervention for future development.

Key Outcomes:
Resilient Cities: Cities with diversified economies (e.g., Mumbai, Bangalore) managed to maintain consistent GDP growth and employment levels, even during challenging times.
Emerging Opportunities: Cities like Pune and Hyderabad continued to grow as innovation hubs, particularly in IT, showing strong future growth potential.
Sectoral Shifts: The ICT sector and services drove much of the economic growth, while traditional sectors such as tourism and manufacturing showed varying levels of recovery.
This project provided a city-specific economic assessment, offering actionable insights for policy-makers, investors, and businesses aiming to understand the economic landscape of India's urban centers.
